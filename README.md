This repository was created with the intention to help others Godot programmers/Godot developers.

This code makes the camera move upon the mouse reaches the borders of the viewport. I also created an Input called __center_camera that is space, upon the player hit the key it will seek for the first node with the tag Player, else it will center in the position 0, 0.
